\textbf{Team name: \emph{HERE PLEASE}}

\textbf{Team members: \emph{HERE PLEASE}}\\
\emph{Note:} Once one person uploads the report to Gradescope, please add all other team members to the submission within the Gradescope interface (top right on your submission).

\textbf{TA name: \emph{HERE PLEASE}}

\section*{Progress Report 1}
For the first project report, we want you to have met with your TA and talked through your plans, and to have set up a weekly meeting with them.

Our goal is to have your proposal sanity checked:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do you actually have the data?
  \item Do you actually have the compute?
  \item Is there code you need but don't have access to?
  \item Is there an area where you need help?
\end{itemize}

Some of these things were outlined in your proposals, but talking through it with your TA helps us find potential road blocks and get the ball rolling.
If you haven't heard from your TA by a few days before the first progress report is due, then please make a private Piazza post and let us know which team you're on. 

Once done, please upload a short document to Gradescope.


\section*{Progress Report 2}

Please provide us with a one-page update describing the progress you've made.
