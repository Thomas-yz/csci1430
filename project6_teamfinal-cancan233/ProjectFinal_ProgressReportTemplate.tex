% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing documents.
% Your task is to answer the questions by filling out this document, then to 
% compile this into a PDF document. 
% You will then upload this PDF to `Gradescope' - the grading system that we will use. 
% Instructions for upload will follow soon.
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex

% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Departmental machines have one installed.
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): http://www.latex-project.org/get/

\section*{Progress Report 1}
For the first project report, we want you to have met with your TA and talked through your plans, and to have set up a weekly meeting with them.

Our goal is to have your proposal sanity checked:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do you actually have the data?
  \item Do you actually have the compute?
  \item Is there code you need but don't have access to?
  \item Is there an area where you need help?
\end{itemize}

Some of these things were outlined in your proposals, but talking through it with your TA helps us find potential road blocks and get the ball rolling.
If you haven't heard from your TA by a few days before the first progress report is due, then please make a private Piazza post and let us know which team you're on. 

Once done, please upload a short document to Gradescope.


\section*{Progress Report 2}

Please provide us with a one-page update describing the progress you've made.
