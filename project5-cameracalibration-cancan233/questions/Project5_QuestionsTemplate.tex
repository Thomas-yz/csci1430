\paragraph{Q3:} In two-view camera geometry, what does it mean when the epipolar lines: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item radiate out of a point on the image plane,
\item converge to a point outside of the image plane, and
\item intersect at more than one point?
\end{enumerate}

We highly recommend using this \href{https://browncsci1430.github.io/webpage/demos/stereo_camera_visualization/index.html}{interactive demo} to explore the different scenarios and get a better feel for epipolar geometry.

\paragraph{Q4:}
Suppose that we have the following three datasets of an object of unknown geometry:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A video circling the object;
\item An stereo pair of calibrated cameras capturing two images of the object; and
\item Two images we take of the object at two different camera poses (position and orientation) using the same camera but with different lens zoom settings.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of the above setups, decide if we can calculate the essential matrix, the fundamental matrix, or both. \\

\paragraph{Q5 (Linear algebra/numpy question):}
Suppose we have a quadrilateral $ABCD$ and a transformed version $A'B'C'D'$ as seen in the image below.

\includegraphics[width=8cm]{quadrilaterals.jpg}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A&=(1, 1)\\
B&=(1.5, 0.5)\\
C&=(2, 1)\\
D&=(2.5, 2)
\end{split}
\quad\quad\quad
\begin{split}
A'&=(-0.3, 1.3)\\
B'&=(0.5, 1.1)\\
C'&=(-0.3, 1.8)\\
D'&=(-0.3, 2.6)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Let's assume that each point in $ABCD$ was approximately mapped to its corresponding point in $A'B'C'D'$ by a $2\times2$ transformation matrix $M$.

e.g. if $A = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ and $A' = \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}$, and $\boldsymbol{M} = \begin{pmatrix} m_{1,1} & m_{1,2} \\ m_{2,1} & m_{2,2} \end{pmatrix}$ 

then $\begin{pmatrix} m_{1,1} & m_{1,2} \\ m_{2,1} & m_{2,2} \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \approx \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}$

We would like to approximate $\boldsymbol{M}$ using least squares for linear regression.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Rewrite the equation $\boldsymbol{M}x \approx x'$ into a pair of linear equations. We have provided you with a template of what they should look like below.

\item Use the equations you wrote for part (a) and coordinate values for $ABCD$ and $A'B'C'D'$ to construct a matrix $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and column vector $b$ that satisfy
\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{Q}*\begin{pmatrix} m_{1,1} \\ m_{1,2} \\ m_{2,1} \\ m_{2,2} \\ \end{pmatrix} = b
\end{align}

We have provided you with a template of what they should look like below.

\emph{Hint:} you have a pair of equations for each $x$-$x'$ correspondence, giving you $8$ rows in $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $b$.

\emph{Note:} Systems of linear equations are typically written in the form $\boldsymbol{A}x=b$, but since we have already defined $A$ and $x$, we're writing it as $\boldsymbol{Q}m=b$

\item Our problem is now over-constrained, so we want to find values for $m_{i,j}$ that minimize the squared error between approximated values and real values, or $||\boldsymbol{Q}m-b||_2$. To do this we use singular value decomposition to find the pseudoinverse of $\boldsymbol{Q}$, written as $\boldsymbol{Q}^\dagger$. We then multiply it by both sides, giving us $\boldsymbol{Q}^\dagger \boldsymbol{Q}m = \boldsymbol{Q}^\dagger b \quad\Rightarrow\quad m \approx \boldsymbol{Q}^\dagger b$.

Thankfully, the computer can do all of this for us! \texttt{numpy.linalg.lstsq()} takes in our $\boldsymbol{Q}$ matrix and $b$ vector, and returns approximations for $m$. Plug the values you wrote in part (b) into that function and write the returned $\boldsymbol{M}$ matrix here.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{A5:} Your answer here.
% Uncomment the stencil below and fill in your solution.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Replace each of the `$\_\_$' below with $x, y, x', y',$ or $0$.
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
    \_\_m_{1,1} + \_\_m_{1,2} + \_\_m_{2,1} + \_\_m_{2,2} = \_\_ \\
    \_\_m_{1,1} + \_\_m_{1,2} + \_\_m_{2,1} + \_\_m_{2,2} = \_\_
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\item Replace each of the `$\_\_$' below with a $0$ or a coordinate value from $ABCD$ and $A'B'C'D'$.
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix} \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_ & \_\_\end{pmatrix} *\begin{pmatrix} m_{1,1} \\ m_{1,2} \\ m_{2,1} \\ m_{2,2} \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \\ \_\_ \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

\item Replace each of the `$\_\_$' below with the value of $m_{i, j}$.
\begin{align}
    M = \begin{pmatrix} m_{1,1} & m_{1,2} \\ m_{2,1} & m_{2,2} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \_\_ & \_\_ \\ \_\_ & \_\_ \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Q6:} 
In searching for solutions to slow the spread of COVID-19, many governments and organizations have looked to technology, some of which uses cameras and computer vision. Please read these articles on
\href{https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/03/21/why-ai-might-be-the-most-effective-weapon-we-have-to-fight-covid-19/}{AI usage during the pandemic} and a \href{https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51439401}{‘close contact detector’}, and answer the following questions. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

    \item 
    Of the computer vision solutions described, which single solution would you most support and why? 
    Which one would you least support and why? (3-4 sentences) \\
    \emph{Note: You may make whichever assumptions you like about how the specific solution might work, but please state them.}
    
    \item 
    Suppose that the `close contact detector' used computer vision as one of its signals, by surreptitiously using your smartphone's cameras along with facial recognition to know who you were near. In a time of crisis, would you be comfortable with this? Why? (3-4 sentences)
\end{enumerate}

The surveillance and biometric measures that help us today may outlast the pandemic and become part of our daily lives. 
\begin{enumerate}[(c)]
    \item
    The computer vision technology behind the `close contact detector' starts to be used by governments to locate missing persons and criminal fugitives through your smartphone, without you knowing. Would you be comfortable with this? Why? (3-4 sentences)
    
    \item
    The technology then becomes commercial software, and it is integrated into a new dating app `Cvpid'. Once installed, as you go about your day, the app passively scans people near you and matches their faces to their social media profiles to find potential partners based on your personal preferences. Would you be comfortable with this? Why? (3-4 sentences)
