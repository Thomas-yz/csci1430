    # or less than 0.0 may cause issues in the functions in Python for saving
    # images to disk. These are called in proj1_part2 after the call to 
    # gen_hybrid_image().
    # One option is to clip (also called clamp) all values below 0.0 to 0.0, 
    # and all values larger than 1.0 to 1.0.
