\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Refer to the \textsc{Project4\_QuestionsTemplate} for information on Q6 of the Project 4 written questions. Please submit this file to Gradescope under the Project 4 Written Code (Numpy)	assignment along with your completed \texttt{model.py}
  \item \textbf{Please make this document anonymous.}

\section*{A6}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do these numbers tell us about the capacity of the network, the complexity of the two problems, the value of training, and the value of the two different classification approaches?

    \item How well did each model perform on each dataset? Please use this table to structure your response.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item NN on MNIST: xx\% (highest accuracy)
        	\begin{itemize}
        	\item Epoch 0 loss: xx     Accuracy: xx\%
        	\item Epoch 9 loss: xx     Accuracy: xx\%
        	\end{itemize}
        \item NN+SVM on MNIST: xx\% (highest accuracy)
        	\begin{itemize}
        	\item Epoch 0 loss: xx     Accuracy: xx\%
