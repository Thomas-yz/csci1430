    \item 
    Why might this affect classification accuracy?

    \item
    Given the situation, describe \emph{two} methods to improve classification accuracy, and explain why they would help.\\ 
    \emph{These can be for k-means, or otherwise.}

\paragraph{Q4:}
Data bias affects machine learning, and recent national news has highlighted data bias in object detection. \href{https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/5/18251924/self-driving-car-racial-bias-study-autonomous-vehicle-dark-skin}{In one case}, researchers discovered that current pedestrian detection models identified darker-skinned pedestrians with 5\% less accuracy than lighter-skinned pedestrians. The researchers investigate multiple reasons for this inaccuracy, but one reason could be that the training dataset had 29\% darker-skinned and 71\% lighter-skinned labeled pedestrians. While measuring this difference in the data might be simple for pedestrians, other data biases can be harder to describe.

In Project 3, we will train a scene recognition model using data from Lazebnik et al.~2006. Please review its data to check for biases: observe image samples in the data/train and data/test directories and consider their class labels.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Does this dataset contain potentially harmful biases? If so, describe them and why they might be harmful. (3--4 sentences.)
\end{enumerate}

Releasing a dataset publicly can caused it to be used in unforeseen applications or by unforeseen actors.

\begin{enumerate}[(b)]
\item Describe a use of this scene dataset that may have been unanticipated. How might this reveal other overlooked biases? (3--4 sentences.)
\end{enumerate}

Please read the following two short articles: \href{https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661128/ai-object-recognition-algorithms-bias-worse-household-items-lower-income-countries}{Article 1} and \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08536.pdf}{Article 2}.

\begin{enumerate}[(c)]
\item Do these articles change your answers? Why or why not? (2--3 sentences).

\paragraph{Q5:} Given a linear classifier such as SVM which separates two classes (binary decision), how might we use multiple linear classifiers to create a new classifier which separates $k$ classes?

Below, we provide pseudocode for a linear classifier. It trains a model on a training set, and then classifies a new test example into one of two classes. Please edit the pseudo-code to convert this into a multi-class classifier. 

\emph{Hints:} See slides in supervised learning crash course deck, plus your own research. You can take either the one vs.~all (or one vs.~others) approach or the one vs.~one approach in the slides; please declare which approach you take.

\emph{More hints:} Be aware that 1) the input labels in the multi-class case are different, and you will need to match the expected label input for the \texttt{train\_linear\_classifier} function, 2) you need to make a new decision on how to aggregate or decide on the most confident prediction.

\emph{Note:} A more efficient software application would separate the classifier training and testing into two different functions so that the model could be reused without retraining. Feel free to ignore this for now.

\emph{Please answer overleaf.}

\begin{python}
# Inputs
#   train_feats: N x d matrix of N features each d descriptor long
#   train_labels: N x 1 array containing values of either -1 (class 0) or 1 (class 1)
#   test_feat: 1 x d image for which we wish to predict a label
#
# Outputs
#   -1 (class 0) or 1 (class 1)
#
# Please turn this into a multi-class classifier for k classes.
# Inputs:
#    As before, except
#    train_labels: N x 1 array of class label integers from 0 to k-1
# Outputs:
#    A class label integer from 0 to k-1
#
def classify(train_feats, train_labels, test_feat)
    # Train classification hyperplane
    weights, bias = train_linear_classifier(train_feats, train_label)
    # Compute distance from hyperplane
    test_score = weights * test_feats + bias

    return 1 if test_score > 0 else -1

\paragraph{Q6:} In Project 3, we will use a feature descriptor called HOG---`Histogram of Oriented Gradients'. As its name implies, it works similarly to SIFT. In classification, we might extract HOG features across the entire image (not just at corners) to create visual words.

HOG creates a feature descriptor per image `block'. Each block is split into `cells' covering pixels. HOG outputs a 9-bin histogram of oriented gradients per cell. We append these together to obtain the feature descriptor for each block. As a result, if we have $(z,z)$ cells per block, the feature descriptor for each block will be of size $z \times z \times 9$. 

\emph{Blocks can overlap as displayed in the diagram below.}
%
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[clip,trim={0cm 0.75cm 0cm 0.75cm},width=11cm]{hog-diagram.png}
\end{center}
%
When using HOG, the parameters such as pixels per cell and cells per block impact the resulting feature descriptor and so our performance on a classification task.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Given a \colorbox{lightgray}{$72\times72$} image, calculate the number of cells, blocks, and feature vector size that will occur when we extract HOG features with the following parameters.

Scenario 1: Pixels per cell = \colorbox{lightgray}{$4\times4$}, cells per block = \colorbox{lightgray}{$4\times4$} % (\emph{like in SIFT!}). 
\\
\emph{Calculate:}
\\ 
Number of cells: 
\\
Number of blocks: 
\\
Dimensions of resulting feature descriptor: 
\\

Scenario 2: Pixels per cell = \colorbox{lightgray}{$8\times8$}, cells per block = \colorbox{lightgray}{$2\times2$}.
\\
\emph{Calculate:}
\\ 
Number of cells:
\\
Number of blocks: 
\\
Dimensions of resulting feature descriptor: 


\item What are the pros and cons of the two parameter combinations? Which might you expect to have better performance?

\emph{Note: You may find it useful to look at the thesis of Navneet Dalal (co-inventor of HOG) for more on this topic. \href{http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/dalal/NavneetDalalThesis.pdf}{[Link to thesis]} (pages 39, 41 in Section 4.3).}
